A timeseries measurement is represented as a timestamp and a vector of double values (DoublesEvent message) in the protobuf schema [ Serialization > Understanding the protobuf object structure]
A number of measurements is sent together in a TimeSeriesDoublesReplicationMessage.

**Example**

This simple example illustrates how to create a timeseries replication message with a simple value and send it to the Edge gateway. In this case we send data from a sensor called "ExternalD1", with a timestamp and a simple double value.
