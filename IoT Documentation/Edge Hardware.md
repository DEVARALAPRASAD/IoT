# Edge Hardware
The hardware usage on the edge will vary depending on whether a full stack of products including edge gateway, storage, stream analytics, and presentation is deployed, or if just an Edge gateway is deployed. For situations where the Kognifai Edge gateway is deployed in a standalone configuration, the hardware requirements are small, but they will of course depend on how many sensor values that will be handled per second.

Clients can either deploy the software on existing hardware, or Kongsberg may provide the hardware and the software as a part of a turn-key solution. In both cases it is strongly recommended that the hardware has a TPM 2.0 chip in order to protect secrets and configuration stored at the edge.
