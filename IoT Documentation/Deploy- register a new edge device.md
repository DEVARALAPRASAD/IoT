# Setting up a new edge device
In order to set up a new edge device, there are three steps which need to be carried out:
1) Run the edge registration tool.
The edge registration tool will register the device with the Kognifai cloud and later download required software
2) A Kongsberg employee will approve the device in the IoT Management Portal and select which software that should be pushed to the device. The software will automatically be downloaded and installed.
3) Use the Sensor Configuration Application to determine which sensors that should be streamed to the cloud

This is further described in the installation documentation
